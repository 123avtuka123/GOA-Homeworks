<img src="basketball2.png" width="500">
<p>Basketball was invented by a Canadian, Dr. James Naismith,<br> while he was teaching physical education at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, <br> Massachusetts, USA. As the legend goes, he felt that the winter sports <br> available werenâ€™t as physically strenuous as summer sports like rugby, soccer, and lacrosse, <br> so on December 5, 1891, he created basketball.</p>
